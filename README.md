# SmailBox - Sigfox powered mailbox

## Description
Tired of checking your mailbox every day? Upgrade it to the next level and get push notifications every time you have got a mail.

This is very simple demo, planed improvements:
- Optimize power consumption
- Send notification when someone open the mailbox so you don't need to check it
- Use NFC on SmartEverything to identify who collects the mails (wife, son, daughter, dog:) - NFC tag on keyring
- Add Sketch for Akeru or other boards
- Ideally create small Arduino based hw prototype to be build in into mailbox for years:)

## Getting the parts
- 1 SmartEverything board (http://www.smarteverything.it)
- 1 Snap action switch (but you can use reed switch, tilt sensor, optical gate - depends on construction of your mailbox)
- 1 100 Î© resistor
- (Optional) 50g of InstaMorph/ShapePlast (same thing different names) to fix the switch in right position. My old plain mailbox is build in "wall of mailboxes" for whole house and there is lack of options how to fix the switch without damaging the other ones. If you are lucky and have just your own, definitely choose some more robust way.


### PushOver
- Login/Sign up to http://pusover.net
- Create new app - https://pushover.net/apps/build and write/copy app TOKEN somewhere you will need it in the next step
- Setup push over url by following scheme and replace %TOKEN% and %USER% with your own values (USER key can be found in the dashboard https://pushover.net/dashboard)
```
https://api.pushover.net/1/messages.json?token=%TOKEN%&user=%USER%&message='You've got mail snr: {snr}'
```
For more options/parameters check https://pushover.net/api

### Sigfox
-  Login into Sigfox [Backend](https://backend.sigfox.com)
-  Configure callback to POST URL with pushover url from the previous step
(open [List of devices](https://backend.sigfox.com/devicetype/list click o) click on device name and in the left menu, select Callbacks)

### Wiring
Its really simple, just snap action switch and the pull down resistor
